## How-to

### First, do a backup
I don't care if you will lose all your original images or not, just copy them in the folder.

### Install the correct python3 requirements
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the application
First, put all your .jpg or .png images in the folder in which you got the main.py, then:
```shell
python3 main.py
```
or
```shell
./main.py
```
