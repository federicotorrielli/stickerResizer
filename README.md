# Telegram sticker resizer

## What is does

Tired of having to manually convert and resize all your images to be fit for Telegram stickers? I got a little script
for you here to ease your life.

**DISCLAIMER**: this won't bring the joy of a loving mother or a good and healty relationship with a female.

## Requirements

- Python (3.4+)
- pip
- A working brain

## How-to

### First, do a backup

I don't care if you will lose all your original images or not, just copy them in the folder.

### Install the correct python3 requirements

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the application

First, put all your .jpg or .png images in the folder in which you got the main.py, then:

```shell
python3 main.py
```

or

```shell
./main.py
```

## Testing

This program was tested on Linux only, testing on other platform by contributors are welcome.

Pull requests are also welcome, of course.
